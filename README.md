## Styling

The included CSS will render your CV in two styles:
s
1. `kjhealy` the original default, inspired by [kjhealy's vita
template](https://github.com/kjhealy/kjh-vita).
2. `davewhipp` is a tweaked version of `kjhealy`, with bigger fonts and dates
  right aligned.

To change the default style, simply change the variable in the
`_config.yml` file.

Any other styling is possible. More CSS style contributions and forks are welcome!
